### My Process

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to leard how to write my html markup and css accordingly and based on their tags or class while writing this project, and I was able to use the hamburger style for my navigation.I also learnt how to use flex basis. I still have more to learn in css. I used some sematics on html and class for css also for example:

html
<section>Some HTML code I'm proud of</section>


css
.music {
  flex-direction: column;
}

### Continued development

I would like to work more on css grid, positioning, css animations and media query.And also to get prepared for what coming next (JavaScript and React).
